    <h1>Web development experience</h1>
    <h3>Cover letter</h3>
    <p>Dear Sir/Madam, I received recognition for completing the basic IT internship at the Zira Talent Academy, and
        successfully passed the second initial internship at Arena - Mistral. My interest in technology since the
        Commodore 64 and 128D brought me to FIT in 2003, but, along with my strong music career, I finally graduated
        from ITEP faculty as a graduate engineer RIT, in 2021, and trained in Web PHP Development- in the IT Academy.
    </p>
    <p>I worked successfully at ZIRA as a UX designer in the previous months, but the contract was terminated because
        there is no longer a need for a UX design profession in the company. I took the opportunity to study FrontEnd
        JavaScript Development at the IT Academy and master's studies at FRN within the PIM University for greater
        career success in my regular occupation.</p>
    <p>It is interesting to know that I have a successful career as a musician on the domestic and European scene, as a
        composer, producer and event organizer. I regularly create on the audio visual level, concerts, AV recording,
        education, editing, etc.</p>
    <p>I will be happy to respond with a prepared summary of my life experiences according to the target IT position,
        and until then I would like to give you an informative list and attach my values ​​so far in the attachment that
        follows.</p>
    <p>Best regards, Gordan Kranjčić</p>

    <h3>Current Experience: UX Design and Software Development</h3>
    <p>Respect, I would like to say a few words about my skills. At ZIRA, I brought graphic and edited video solutions
        for marketing communications, prepared illustrations, found myself in event management and musical team
        building, designed and translated content in English for ads and pages, proofread documentation and formatted it
        on Confluence, he tried his hand at software development at the Zira Talent Academy.</p>
    <p>I hold a Master of Science degree in Computer and Information Technology and have completed several studies in
        web development at the Info Group ITAcademy, specializing in Web PHP Development and Front-End JavaScript
        Development. Additionally, I participated in internship programs at Zira Talent Academy and Paragon Mistral..
    </p>

    <p>In ZIRA, I mostly worked on prototypes of wireframe pages in Balsamique, based on Mistral's best practice, and
        since the Telco industry does not have constant ux design needs, I see myself in a new workplace with experience
        in user experience design, ready for a new employment relationship from January in 2023</p>

    <p>Since my employers highly recommended me, with great pleasure they offered to contact them personally and check
        the quality of our previous cooperation
        <a href="mailto:lejla.Pljevljak-Rasidagic@zira.com.ba">send an email to the employer</a>

    <p>Please give me guidance so that I can put myself in the most favorable position to apply for the position with 
        by the mentioned experience.</p>
