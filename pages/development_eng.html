    <h1>Web Development Experience</h1>
    <h3>Cover Letter</h3>
    <p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
    <p>I was recognized for completing a foundational IT internship at the Zira Talent Academy and successfully advanced
        through an additional internship at Arena - Mistral. My long-standing interest in technology, which began with
        the
        Commodore 64 and 128D, led me to pursue studies at FIT in 2003. However, alongside a dedicated music career, I
        eventually graduated from the ITEP Faculty in 2021 with a degree in RIT engineering. I then specialized in Web
        PHP
        Development through the IT Academy.</p>
    <p>Recently, I worked as a UX designer at ZIRA, where I successfully contributed until the position was discontinued
        due to shifting company needs. Seizing the opportunity, I pursued further studies in Front-End JavaScript
        Development at the IT Academy and began a master’s program in FRN at PIM University to enhance my career
        prospects.</p>
    <p>In addition to my IT background, I have built a successful music career on both the domestic and European stages,
        where I work as a composer, producer, and event organizer. I am deeply involved in creating audio-visual
        content,
        including concerts, AV recording, education, editing, and more.</p>
    <p>I would be happy to provide a detailed summary of my experiences tailored to the specific IT role. In the
        meantime,
        please find an overview of my skills and achievements attached.</p>
    <p>Best regards,
        Gordan Kranjčić</p>

    <h3>Current Experience: UX Design and Software Development</h3>
    <p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
    <p>I would like to share some insights into my skills and experience. At ZIRA, I contributed to graphic and video
        editing for marketing communications, created illustrations, supported event management and musical team
        building,
        and produced content in English for advertisements and web pages. I also proofread and formatted documentation
        on
        Confluence and gained hands-on experience in software development through the Zira Talent Academy.</p>
    <p>I hold a Master of Science degree in Computer and Information Technology and have completed specialized studies
        in
        Web PHP Development and Front-End JavaScript Development at the Info Group ITAcademy. Additionally, I took part
        in
        internship programs at Zira Talent Academy and Paragon Mistral.</p>
    <p>During my time at ZIRA, I focused on creating wireframe prototypes in Balsamiq, guided by Mistral’s best
        practices.
        Given that UX design needs are not constant in the Telco industry, I am seeking new opportunities to apply my
        user
        experience design expertise. I am available to start a new role beginning January 2023.</p>
    <p>My former employers have kindly offered to serve as references. They would be happy to confirm the quality of our
        collaboration; you can reach them directly

    <p>I welcome any guidance you may provide to help me best position myself for this role, leveraging the experience
        and
        skills mentioned above.</p>
    <p>Best regards,
        Gordan Kranjčić</p>

    <h3>A Report on Technologies That I Am Familiar With</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>For an overview of my recent experience at ZIRA, including frontend UX design, full-stack development
            practices at
            Zira Talent Academy, and training at Mistral Arena and Paragon, please refer to my 
            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gordankranjcic">LinkedIn profile</a>
        </li>
        <li>My CV and cover letter provide a detailed outline of my professional experience before my current role.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Throughout my career, I initially worked in marketing roles at ZIRA (outlined in the "Current Experience"
        section)
        before transitioning to the production department, where I specialized in UX design and continued my training in
        web
        development.</p>
    <p>Currently, my primary focus is on frontend technologies, particularly Frontend JavaScript Development (ITA),
        building on my background in design and frontend programming. Additionally, I have a strong interest in Software
        Testing and Quality Assurance as potential career advancements.</p>
    <p>At the Zira Talent Academy, I worked with technologies such as Java Spring Boot for backend development,
        alongside
        tools like Maven, TypeScript, and Angular, integrated within ZIRA's custom frontend framework. The backend
        utilizes
        Hibernate, and I worked with pre-existing APIs and Swagger for testing. Our development environment included
        VSCode,
        Node.js, and Eclipse, with GitLab version control through Fork, and DBeaver for PostgreSQL database management.
    </p>
    <p>During my time at the Mistral Arena with Paragon, I completed 200 tasks focused on JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3.
    </p>
    <p>At the ITA PHP Web Development Academy, I gained hands-on experience with PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, server
        setup,
        SQL, internet marketing, and security. We worked with MySQL, XAMPP, Dreamweaver, and Notepad++ across various
        modules.</p>
    <p>At ITEP Faculty, I completed approximately 40 subjects, achieving a 9.3 GPA. My coursework covered a range of
        topics
        including databases, SQL, mathematics, OOP, and programming languages such as Java and JavaScript. Additional
        areas
        included HTML, XML, security, cryptography, networking, software engineering, and architecture. My studies
        extended
        to design programs like AutoCAD, 3D Studio Max (CAD design), and Adobe Suite (InDesign, Dreamweaver, Photoshop,
        Illustrator, Premiere Pro, After Effects, and Audition). I also specialized in music video production. Most of
        my
        academic work centered on computer science and software development, with Java fundamentals in NetBeans, Tomcat
        server, JSP, JSF, and MySQL.</p>
    <p>Enclosed with this document are my CV and cover letter, which further detail my diverse experience and my current
        specialization in frontend UI/UX.</p>
